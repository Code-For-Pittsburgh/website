# Code For Pittsburgh Website


This website aims to be a strong foundation for Code For Pittsburgh. It provides a clear and organized website for users.


## Folder structure

This website is built following a very simple structure:
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `data`: Folder to store any kind of data
    - `Screen`: These are for future dev


## Components

Components are the basic blocks of a react application. To ensure readability, components are saved as their own `.js` file. 

These components can be fined in the `components` folder. There are multiple components and each serve a very important role.
